Unicycle
==========



## unicycle learning ######

This is code to study reinforcement learning.

DDQN and A3C codes are based on 
[the codes of Jaromir](https://jaromiru.com/2016/10/03/lets-make-a-dqn-implementation/)  
Also you can find a great explaination of Jaromir on [_here_](https://jaromiru.com/)  
Steeve Huang's medium [page](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-various-reinforcement-learning-algorithms-i-q-learning-sarsa-dqn-ddpg-72a5e0cb6287)  
Unicycle simulation is using [_pybullet_](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3)
physics modeling.

Should be changed list:

  * visual input and camera control
  * pybullet torque bug
  * New algorithms (PPO)
  * torque, angular acceleration reading
  * multi thread
